# novia-challenge
This repository is designed to provide candidates with the necessary framework to complete the Novia Extraordinarily Rigorous Data Science Test for Aspiring Candidates (NERDSTAC).

What to expect:

* Duration: Aim to spend about 2-2.5 hours on this challenge. 
* Sections: The challenge consists of 4 sections, combining open questions (to be answered in Google Forms) and hands-on tasks (to be completed in a Jupyter notebook). 
* Flexibility: Don't feel pressured to complete every section. We've intentionally included extra content to allow you to shine in your areas of expertise.

Key points to remember:

* If you get stuck, don't dwell too long on one section. Move on and show us what you can do elsewhere.
* After approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes, please move on to Section 4. Once you finish Section 4, if time permits, you are free to go back and continue working on the previous sections.  
* We're here to help â€“ don't hesitate to reach out with questions.
* You are encouraged to use any resources you find helpful to complete this challenge.  
* Ensure your code is clear and well-documented. This helps in showcasing your thought process and approach.
